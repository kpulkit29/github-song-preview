# Github-song-preview 🎵🎵

Like listening to music while you're coding?? If yes, then you landed in the right place 😁😁. Github Profile Readme is a great way to give others a sneak peek into your coding world. Why not tell others what songs you're listening to while coding. With Github-song-preview you can do that in three simple steps. 

 - Open https://song-preview-readme.herokuapp.com/
 - Search for your song.
 - See a preview of your song card.
 - Copy the mardown code and paste it into your Github profile Readme.
 
 **When the song card is clicked, it takes you to that song's video on youtube**
